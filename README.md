# PhyloConvNetPolimi

Follows the structure of the repository:

In [this file](./The_whole_pipeline.ipynb) you can find the full pipeline of our method, which consists in the following steps. This file exploits some functions coming from [this file](./data_proc_dm_generation.py). This last module has as dependency the code inside the [PhyloCNN layer](./phcnn) folder.

# Experiments:

1. Conduct statistical tests for various distance matrices significance.
2. Contrast the distances through features filtering

# Progressing:

1. The concept of distance matrices is proven to work. A good example of a distance matrix is being searched.
